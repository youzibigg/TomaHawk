## v0.1

### Release summary
- Establishes the current public baseline for the TomaHawk / 战斧 local naval sandbox.
- Formalizes the repository's current release line as `v0.1`.
- Captures the lightweight Node.js + browser runtime and deterministic simulation core already present in the repository.

### Included in v0.1
- Local static server via `server.mjs` serving the application at `127.0.0.1:4173`.
- Browser-based tactical map UI implemented in `src/app.js` and `src/styles.css`.
- Deterministic naval combat simulation core implemented in `src/sim.js`.
- Seeded scenario creation, setup/running/ended modes, and JSON save/load/AAR export.
- Force-level doctrine, offensive raid planning, defensive missile allocation, and ROE-aware engagement logic.
- Imperfect radar tracks, cooperative force-picture abstraction, and profile-based missile detection behavior.
- Four ship hull categories: `DDG`, `CCG`, `BBG`, and `FFG`.
- Five modeled missile families: `SM-2MR`, `ESSM`, `MaritimeStrike`, `TomahawkBlockV`, and `SM-6`.
- Existing automated regression coverage through `npm test` (`node --test`).
- Expanded top-level documentation in `README.md` for both English and Chinese readers.

### Documentation set for v0.1

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`
- `docs/SIMULATION_ASSUMPTIONS.md`
